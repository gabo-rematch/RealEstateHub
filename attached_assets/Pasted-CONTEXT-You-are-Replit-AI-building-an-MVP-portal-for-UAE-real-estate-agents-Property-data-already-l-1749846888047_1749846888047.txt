CONTEXT
You are Replit AI building an MVP portal for UAE real-estate agents.
Property data already lives in Supabase; don’t assume or redefine its schema.
The UI is mobile-first but works on desktop.

OBJECTIVE
Create a single-page web app (React + Vite + Tailwind) that lets agents:

Search units with filters.

Select one or many results.

Inquire repeatedly in the same browser session without re-entering details.

On each inquiry submission, POST JSON to a webhook URL (provided later via env var).

No other features are required.

SCOPE
In Scope
Feature	Details
Search filters	See “SEARCH FILTERS”.
Results list	Card view, newest first, deduplicate identical units.
Selection & FAB	Checkbox on each card; floating Inquire button appears once ≥ 1 card selected.
Inquiry form	Pre-filled on first open from filters, then from last submission (sessionStorage).
Repeat inquiries	User can open form for additional units; fields persist until page refresh.

Not in Scope
Authentication

State persistence across sessions

Message anonymization

Database writes (all submissions go to webhook)

Analytics beyond console logs

SEARCH FILTERS
Required (sticky): unit_kind, transaction_type
Optional: property_type, beds, area_sqft_min/max, price_min/max, community, off_plan, distressed
Show “No results — adjust filters” if query returns zero rows.

UI SPECIFICATION
1️⃣ Search Screen
Mobile-first layout (flex column, vertical scroll).

Filters accordion at top, results list below.

Each card: core info + 120-char message preview.

Sort by updated_at DESC.

2️⃣ Floating Action Button
Bottom-right on mobile (bottom-left desktop).

Disabled until at least one card selected.

3️⃣ Inquiry Form Modal
Opens on FAB click.

Required fields:

Pre-filled search values

Agent WhatsApp Number (tel input, validate ‘+’ & digits)

Optional: notes, portal link / image URL

On Submit:

Build payload { selectedUnitIds: [...], formData: {...}, timestamp }

fetch(WEBHOOK_URL, { method:'POST', headers:{'Content-Type':'application/json'}, body: JSON.stringify(payload) })

Toast “Inquiry sent!” then close modal

Cache form data to sessionStorage for next inquiry

4️⃣ State Reset
“New Search” button clears filters, results, selections, sessionStorage.

ACCEPTANCE TESTS (Cypress)
Search returns results with valid filters.

“No results” notice shows when appropriate.

Selecting cards enables FAB; unselecting disables it.

Inquiry form blocks submit without valid WhatsApp number.

Form pre-fills correctly on first and subsequent opens.

Submit triggers a POST to WEBHOOK_URL with correct JSON payload and shows confirmation toast.

DELIVERABLES
/frontend – React project (Vite, Tailwind, Supabase JS).

README.md – setup & run instructions plus env vars:

VITE_SUPABASE_URL

VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

VITE_WEBHOOK_URL (the POST destination)

cypress/ – tests covering the criteria above.

Build mobile-first, commit all code, and ensure npm run dev serves on port 3000.
